# Principles ↔ Site Pillars

This aligns internal principles to the public “What we do” (operating model) so messaging stays consistent with how we actually work.

## Internal Principles

1. Reliability by Design
2. Run What We Build
3. Outcome Over Orchestration

## Site Pillars (Home3 → What we do)

- We own the outcome → (3) Outcome Over Orchestration
- Small steps, steady cadence → (3) Outcome Over Orchestration
- Build it and run it → (2) Run What We Build
- Clear pricing & approvals → (3) Outcome Over Orchestration (clarity, approvals)
- Reliability and care → (1) Reliability by Design + (2) Run What We Build
- Straight talk, one channel → (3) Outcome Over Orchestration (simplicity/clarity)

## Gaps / Future

- Consider adding subtle cues about security and observability under “Reliability and care” on site copy (without listing tools)
- Pricing page should reaffirm estimate‑first policy and care plan scope (ties to Principles 2 & 3)
- Services page examples should show evidence of reliability (SLOs, incident handling) without naming internal tooling
